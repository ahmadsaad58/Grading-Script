## Graded Folder

This folder contains the assignments that are graded and no longer need grading. Scores should range from a <i>cutoff</i> to 100 points. 

The grades and comments will be available in a <i>CSV file </i> and should be uploaded to Google Drive for the other TAs to reference

The file looks like this:
